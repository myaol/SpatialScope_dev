# SpatialScope <img src="man/figures/logo_spatialscope.png" align="right" height="120" />

SpatialScope is designed to facilitate the ROI-specific exploration, visualization, and analysis of spatial transcriptomics data.

**SpatialScope** is an interactive R package with a browser-based interface that enables spatial visualization and analysis directly from processed Seurat objects. Users can interactively select regions of interest (ROI), visualize gene expression patterns, and perform downstream analyses such as cell-type signature scoring, clustering, and differential expression analysis. In addition to the GUI, SpatialScope also provides a set of modular functions for scripted workflows, enabling customized analyses. Usage examples for these functions are provided in the [Function Workflow Vignette](vignettes_functions.Rmd).

SpatialScope can be accessed via a public demo hosted by the University of Pittsburgh: [https://shiny.crc.pitt.edu/spatial_api/](https://shiny.crc.pitt.edu/spatial_api/).

**Note:** This instance is intended for demonstration purposes only and does not support concurrent user uploads or large-scale use.

## Installation

If you haven’t installed the required Bioconductor packages (Seurat, GSVA), run the following first:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install(c("Seurat", "GSVA"))
```

You can then install SpatialScope directly from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("myaol/SpatialScope")
```

---

## Launching the App

### With Example Data

```r
library(SpatialScopeDev)
run_SpatialScope("demo")
```

### With Your Own Data

```r
library(SpatialScopeDev)
Seurat_object <- readRDS("path/to/your_seurat.rds")
run_spatial_selector(Seurat_object, sample_name = "MyExperiment", show_image = TRUE)
```

Or upload through the app interface in the Visualization section using the 📤 **Upload Data** panel.

**Requirements:** Seurat object with spatial coordinates, raw or normalized expression data, and H&E image.

## ROI Selection Tool

### Quick Spot Selection with `draw_ROI()`

If you only need to select spots from a region of interest without launching the full analysis app:

```r
library(SpatialScopeDev)

# Load your Seurat object
Seurat_object <- readRDS("path/to/your_seurat.rds")

# Launch interactive ROI selector
selected_spots <- draw_ROI(Seurat_object, sample_name = "MyExperiment")

# The function returns a vector of spot IDs
print(selected_spots)
length(selected_spots)

# Use the selected spots for downstream analysis
subset_data <- subset(Seurat_object, cells = selected_spots)
```

This function supports multiple ROI selections and returns a vector of spot IDs, ideal for custom downstream workflows.

## Disclaimer

SpatialScope is designed to facilitate intuitive visualization, region selection, and exploratory analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. The tool provides convenient interfaces for clustering, differential expression, and feature comparison, but these analyses are intended for exploratory purposes only. Users should validate any biological interpretations using appropriate statistical or experimental methods.
